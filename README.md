## About the Project
This project is a solution to the [Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100) taken from Frontend Mentor and made in *ReactJS* using *React Hooks* and *Styled Components*.

## Technologies and Standards Used
**The technologies that have been used are:**
1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
3. ReactJS
4. React Styled Components

### [ReactJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for creating single-page applications and reusable UI components. In this project, we are using *React Hooks* for creating UI components and have enabled typechecking With [*PropTypes*](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) for the UI components that needs some props.

### [Styled Components](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled--components-DB7093?style=for-the-badge&logo=styled-components&logoColor=white)
[*Styled components*](https://styled-components.com/) are a CSS-in-JS tool that bridges the gap between components and styling.  
**Why Styled Components?**  
- *Automatic vendor prefixing* - We can use standard CSS properties, and styled components will add vendor prefixes should they be needed.

- *Unique class names* - Styled components generates unique class names for our styles. We never have to worry about duplication, overlap or misspellings.

- *Simple dynamic styling* -  Adapting the styling of a component based on its props or a global theme is simple and intuitive without having to manually manage dozens of classes.

- *Painless maintenance* - We never have to hunt across different files to find the styling affecting our component, so maintenance is a piece of cake no matter how big our codebase is.
